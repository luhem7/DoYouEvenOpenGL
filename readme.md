##Introduction

This project is merely a testbed for me to really learn OpenGL. Till now, I had sorta garnered my knowledge of OpenGL from bits and pieces here and there on the internet. This project is my first legit attempt to learn Opengl from front to back.

I am following the tutorial here: <http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html>

Eventhough the tutorial teaches OpenGL in C++, I am going to program in Java. Because i cant be arsed to learn C++ again, and Java is good enough for what I want to do. The OpenGL libraries I am using for Java is lwjgl. Learn more about it here: <http://www.lwjgl.org/>
